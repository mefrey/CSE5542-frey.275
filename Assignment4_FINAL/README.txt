For this lab, I used webGL with the framework Three.js

I added a cube to the center of the scene, and made each face of the cube a different texture material

TO RUN THIS PROGRAM: simply open the P4.html file with a web browser of your choice, the scripts attach should automatically run. If you have any trouble, contact me.
