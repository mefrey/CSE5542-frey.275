For this lab, I used webGL with the framework Three.js

I placed my bot in the scene, made the floor as large as the camera far clipping plane. I used StereoCamera from Three.js and used their pre-existing methods to create the stereo effect
for the camera, this still required setting up the viewport for each side of the camera so I figured that would be appropriate for this assignment.

TO RUN THIS PROGRAM: simply open the P2.html file with a web browser of your choice, the scripts attach should automatically run. If you have any trouble, contact me.
