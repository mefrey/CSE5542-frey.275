For this lab, after struggling immensely with openGL I decided to switch to webGL and make heavy use of the preexisting framework Three.js

I simply used their tools to make primitive shapes, and created each in their own function, with the option to increase the "resolution" or number of segments for each, defaulting with 1

TO RUN THIS PROGRAM: simply open the P1.html file with a web browser of your chose, the scripts attach should automatically run. If you have any trouble, contact me.
